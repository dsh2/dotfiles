# 	Controls what happens when Readline wants to ring the terminal
# 	bell. If set to ‘none’, Readline never rings the bell. If set to
# 	‘visible’, Readline uses a visible bell if one is available. If
# 	set to ‘audible’ (the default), Readline attempts to ring the
# 	terminal’s bell.
set bell-style none

# 	If set to ‘on’, Readline attempts to bind the control characters
# 	treated specially by the kernel’s terminal driver to their
# 	Readline equivalents.
set bind-tty-special-chars on

# 	The string to insert at the beginning of the line when the
# 	insert-comment command is executed. The default value is "#".
set comment-begin '#'

# 	The number of screen columns used to display possible matches
# 	when performing completion. The value is ignored if it is less
# 	than 0 or greater than the terminal screen width. A value of 0
# 	will cause matches to be displayed one per line. The default
# 	value is -1.
set completion-display-width -1

# 	If set to ‘on’, Readline performs filename matching and
# 	completion in a case-insensitive fashion. The default value is
# 	‘off’.
set completion-ignore-case on

# 	If set to ‘on’, and completion-ignore-case is enabled, Readline
# 	treats hyphens (‘-’) and underscores (‘_’) as equivalent when
# 	performing case-insensitive filename matching and completion.
set completion-map-case on

# 	The length in characters of the common prefix of a list of
# 	possible completions that is displayed without modification.
# 	When set to a value greater than zero, common prefixes longer
# 	than this value are replaced with an ellipsis when displaying
# 	possible completions.
set completion-prefix-display-length 3

# 	The number of possible completions that determines when the user
# 	is asked whether the list of possibilities should be displayed.
# 	If the number of possible completions is greater than this
# 	value, Readline will ask the user whether or not he wishes to
# 	view them; otherwise, they are simply listed. This variable must
# 	be set to an integer value greater than or equal to 0. A
# 	negative value means Readline should never ask. The default
# 	limit is 100.
set completion-query-items 10000

# 	If set to ‘on’, Readline will convert characters with the eighth
# 	bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth bit and
# 	prefixing an ESC character, converting them to a meta-prefixed
# 	key sequence. The default value is ‘on’.
set convert-meta true

# 	If set to ‘On’, Readline will inhibit word completion.
# 	Completion characters will be inserted into the line as if they
# 	had been mapped to self-insert. The default is ‘off’.
set disable-completion off

# 	The editing-mode variable controls which default set of key
# 	bindings is used. By default, Readline starts up in Emacs
# 	editing mode, where the keystrokes are most similar to Emacs.
# 	This variable can be set to either ‘emacs’ or ‘vi’.
set editing-mode emacs
# set editing-mode vi

# 	When set to ‘on’, on operating systems that indicate they
# 	support it, readline echoes a character corresponding to a
# 	signal generated from the keyboard. The default is ‘on’.
set echo-control-characters on

# 	When set to ‘on’, Readline will try to enable the application
# 	keypad when it is called. Some systems need this to enable the
# 	arrow keys. The default is ‘off’.
set enable-keypad off

# 	When set to ‘on’, Readline will try to enable any meta modifier
# 	key the terminal claims to support when it is called. On many
# 	terminals, the meta key is used to send eight-bit characters.
# 	The default is ‘on’.
set enable-meta-key on

# 	If set to ‘on’, tilde expansion is performed when Readline
# 	attempts word completion. The default is ‘off’.
set expand-tilde on

# 	If set to ‘on’, the history code attempts to place the point
# 	(the current cursor position) at the same location on each
# 	history line retrieved with previous-history or next-history.
# 	The default is ‘off’.
set history-preserve-point on

# 	Set the maximum number of history entries saved in the history
# 	list. If set to zero, the number of entries in the history list
# 	is not limited.
set history-size 0

# 	This variable can be set to either ‘on’ or ‘off’. Setting it to
# 	‘on’ means that the text of the lines being edited will scroll
# 	horizontally on a single screen line when they are longer than
# 	the width of the screen, instead of wrapping onto a new screen
# 	line. By default, this variable is set to ‘off’.
set horizontal-scroll-mode  off

# 	If set to ‘on’, Readline will enable eight-bit input (it will
# 	not clear the eighth bit in the characters it reads), regardless
# 	of what the terminal claims it can support. The default value is
# 	‘off’. The name meta-flag is a synonym for this variable.
set input-meta off

# 	The string of characters that should terminate an incremental
# 	search without subsequently executing the character as a command
# 	(see Searching). If this variable has not been given a value,
# 	the characters ESC and C-J will terminate an incremental search.
# set isearch-terminators VALUE

# 	Sets Readline’s idea of the current keymap for key binding
# 	commands. Acceptable keymap names are emacs, emacs-standard,
# 	emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-move, vi-command, and vi-insert.
# 	vi is equivalent to vi-command; emacs is equivalent to
# 	emacs-standard. The default value is emacs. The value of the
# 	editing-mode variable also affects the default keymap.
set keymap emacs

# 	If set to ‘on’, completed directory names have a slash appended.
# 	The default is ‘on’.
set mark-directories on

# 	This variable, when set to ‘on’, causes Readline to display an
# 	asterisk (‘*’) at the start of history lines which have been
# 	modified. This variable is ‘off’ by default.
set mark-modified-lines on

# 	If set to ‘on’, completed names which are symbolic links to
# 	directories have a slash appended (subject to the value of
# 	mark-directories). The default is ‘off’.
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# 	This variable, when set to ‘on’, causes Readline to match files
# 	whose names begin with a ‘.’ (hidden files) when performing
# 	filename completion. If set to ‘off’, the leading ‘.’ must be
# 	supplied by the user in the filename to be completed. This
# 	variable is ‘on’ by default.
set match-hidden-files off

# 	If set to ‘on’, menu completion displays the common prefix of
# 	the list of possible completions (which may be empty) before
# 	cycling through the list. The default is ‘off’.
set menu-complete-display-prefix on

# 	If set to ‘on’, Readline will display characters with the eighth
# 	bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence.
# 	The default is ‘off’.
# set output-meta VALUE

# 	If set to ‘on’, Readline uses an internal more-like pager to
# 	display a screenful of possible completions at a time. This
# 	variable is ‘on’ by default.
set page-completions off

# 	If set to ‘on’, Readline will display completions with matches
# 	sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the
# 	screen. The default is ‘off’.
set print-completions-horizontally on

# 	If set to ‘on’, Readline will undo all changes to history lines
# 	before returning when accept-line is executed. By default,
# 	history lines may be modified and retain individual undo lists
# 	across calls to readline. The default is ‘off’.
set revert-all-at-newline off

# 	This alters the default behavior of the completion functions. If
# 	set to ‘on’, words which have more than one possible completion
# 	cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing
# 	the bell. The default value is ‘off’.
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# 	This alters the default behavior of the completion functions in
# 	a fashion similar to show-all-if-ambiguous. If set to ‘on’,
# 	words which have more than one possible completion without any
# 	possible partial completion (the possible completions don’t
# 	share a common prefix) cause the matches to be listed
# 	immediately instead of ringing the bell. The default value is
# 	‘off’.
set show-all-if-unmodified on

# 	If set to ‘on’, this alters the default completion behavior when
# 	inserting a single match into the line. It’s only active when
# 	performing completion in the middle of a word. If enabled,
# 	readline does not insert characters from the completion that
# 	match characters after point in the word being completed, so
# 	portions of the word following the cursor are not duplicated.
# 	For instance, if this is enabled, attempting completion when the
# 	cursor is after the ‘e’ in ‘Makefile’ will result in ‘Makefile’
# 	rather than ‘Makefilefile’, assuming there is a single possible
# 	completion. The default value is ‘off’.
set skip-completed-text on

# 	If set to ‘on’, a character denoting a file’s type is appended
# 	to the filename when listing possible completions. The default
# 	is ‘off’.
set visible-stats on
